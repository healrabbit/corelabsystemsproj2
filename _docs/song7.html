<div style="width:60%; margin-left:40px"> <p style="color:#707149; font-size:20px"> This song reminds me of my old best friend. Shoutout them. We used to bump it in the car together and laugh about the lyric &quot;Show me the banana&quot; . A little while after moving to New York for school we stopped talking completely. I think they dislike me. I&#39;m not sure why. The song is still good.</p> </div>

Not like I'm counting the days <p>
But it's been twenty five <p>
You're out there killing the game <p>
But damn, I miss you tonight <p>
And I'm out at a party, they're playing our song <p>
I cry on the dance floor, it's so embarrassing <p>
Don't send me photos, you're making it worse <p>
'Cause you're so hot, it's hurting my feelings <p>
I get a little lonely <p>
Get a little more close to me <p>
You're the only one who knows me, babe <p>
So hot, you're hurting my feelings <p>
Can't deal<p>
&nbsp<p>
Before the X rated dreaming <p>
Back on the coast to coast life <p>
You know I live for the hustle <p>
But damn, I miss you tonight <p>
&nbsp<p>
And I'm out at a party, they're playing our song <p>

&nbsp<p>
I get a little lonely <p>
Get a little more close to me <p>
You're the only one who knows me, babe <p>
So hot, you're hurting my feelings  <p>
Can't deal <p>
&nbsp<p>
Show me the banana (na-na-na-na-na) <p>
Show me the banana (na-na-na)<p>
Show me the banana (na-na-na-na-na)<p>
Show me the banana (na-na-na)<p>

So hot, you're hurting my feelings <p>
Can't deal <p>
So hot, you're hurting my feelings<p>
Can't deal <p>
So hot, you're hurting my feelings<p>
Can't deal
