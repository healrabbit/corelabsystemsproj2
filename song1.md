why: This song was off the project Teen Week. Teen Week changed my life. I was in the listening party when it dropped, and it inspired so many people in the little underground community the genre it was a part of was forming. I wrote my college admission essay about Teen Week. This song is special because it's such a picture of my teen experience. Feeling insecure and underappreciated in my real life small town while trying to make a name for myself creatively online. All official releases of this song were sadly removed from the internet when the album became abridged.

&nbsp<p>
I know that you don't want me at your house, just say it<p>
I'm walking aimless, kick me out, I'll take it<p>
One day you'll switch up on me when I'm famous<p>
Can't be in the same place if you're gonna hate it<p>
I know you hate it, see the way you fake it<p>
See me in your posts untagged like I'm nameless<p>
You're not even acting abrasive<p>
We're not even friends and it's blatant<p>
&nbsp<p>
I'm sorry that I didn't talk, I'm such a nuisance<p>
Can't even fuckin' tell my friends that I make music<p>
Bitch, I'm the blueprint, you been acting ruthless<p>
Give me my credit where it's due, no more choosing<p>
Do it tomorrow, I hit snooze, money pooling<p>
Are you even making fuckin' money doing school shit?<p>
I never thought I'd be one ofâ€” (Z-Z-Zero)<p>
I'll always be a fuckin' zero, that's not new shit<p>
&nbsp<p>
One more, two more, three more down the drain<p>
I lost everybody but I feel the same<p>
&nbsp<p>
You become the beast of a friend that I once knew<p>
Never thought that you'd be treating me like a loose screw<p>
I thought I knew you, guess not<p>
I've always wondered what it's like to watch a friend drop<p>
Pen drop? Guess not<p>
Never thought that you'd be treating me like a loose screw<p>
I thought I knew you, guess not<p>
I've always wondered what it's like to watch a friend drop<p>
&nbsp<p>
Do you play my music at night?<p>
Do you play my music when you're alone?<p>
Do you think I did it right?<p>
Would you play it again tomorrow?<p>
Kicking rocks on the way home<p>
You won the game, you can rub it in<p>
I'll still get my trophy even if I throw it in the dustbin<p>
No plans, I wanna be your best friend<p>
Meet ends, I'm dancin' 'til the world ends<p>
Deep cleanse, showcasing all my defects<p>
I'm sorry that I can't be perfect<p>
I'm worthless, I'm helpless, I'm lazy and I'm jealous<p>
But on the outside, I try so hard to be selfless<p>
I'm precious, I always try to act, I'm reckless<p>
&nbsp<p>
You become the beast of a friend that I once knew<p>
Never thought that you'd be treating me like a loose screw<p>
I thought I knew you, guess not<p>
I've always wondered what it's like to watch a friend drop<p>
Pen drop? Guess not<p>
Never thought that you'd be treating me like a loose screw<p>
I thought I knew you, guess not<p>
I've always wondered what it's like to watch a friend drop<p>
