What moon songs do you sing your babies?<p>
What sunshine do you bring?<p>
Who belongs, who decides who's crazy?<p>
Who rights wrongs where others cling?<p>
&nbsp<p>
I'll sing for you<p>
If you want me to<p>
I'll give to you<p>
And it's a chance I'll have to take<p>
And it's a chance I'll have to break<p>
I go along, just because I'm lazy<p>
&nbsp<p>
I go along to be with you<p>
And those moon songs that you sing your babies<p>
Will be the songs to see you through<p>
I'll hear your song<p>
If you want me to<p>
&nbsp<p>
I'll sing along
And it's a chance I'll have to take<p>
And it's a chance I'll have to break<p>
&nbsp<p>
I'm in love with you<p>
I'm in love with you<p>
I'm in love with you and you<p>
I'm in love with you (so in love)<p>
I'm in love with you (with you)<p>
I'm in love with you and you<p>
I'm in love with you (so in love)<p>
I'm in love with you (I'm so in love)<p>
I'm in love with you
