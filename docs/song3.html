<div style="width:60%; margin-left:40px"> <p style="color:#a89d8a; font-size:20px"> Oh where do I even start. Come In by Weatherday is first and foremost a painting album. I turn it on on loop to zone out while I paint. But this song is more than that. This is a song that brings hope in desperate times. A reminder that a poorly drawn person can still be loved. In a similar vein to pure, this song is like a soft friend.</p> </div>

As long as you are by my side, it feels like everything's going to be okay
<p> &nbsp;<p>
She will feel your scent again<p>
When you're no longer around<p>
And every single weather day<p>
She will go outside to smoke<p>
Where she first knew<p>
She would always be<p>
This much wrong<p>
And embarrassing<p>
<p> &nbsp;<p>
I know it’s selfish but whatever<p>
Anyway, I am ok with that you’ll never stay<p>
I know it’s selfish but whatever<p>
Anyway, I am ok with that you’ll never stay<p>
<p> &nbsp;<p>
I’m still here<p>
I’m almost floored<p>
Poorly drawn<p>
I hope you’re bored<p>
Sinking feeling<p>
Weather day<p>
I’m still here<p>
I hope you'll stay<p>
I’m still here<p>
I’m almost floored<p>
Poorly drawn<p>
I hope you’re bored<p>
Sinking feeling<p>
Weather day<p>
I’ll still here<p>
I hope you’ll stay<p>
<p> &nbsp;<p>
At any rate, I'm not sure what I would've done without you
