why: This is the song that I weep to for comfort when I feel like I am not enough, like hugging a plush toy tight. It was my top song on Spotify Wrapped for three years in a row, 2021-2023. I like that 8485 says it was written about trying to be christlike but not knowing if you can. I'm not religious but I feel a strange resonance with it. Just that general feeling of wanting to feel perfect and virtuous and clean. Also, although the song itself released on soundcloud in 2020, it was released officially on the album "plague town" on April 14, 2021, just one day before my birthday. I thought that was so special.

<div style="font-size:10px;">
There was a time once, I thought I could be like you
<p>
You should've seen it, all of the meaning, and all of what I can't do anymore
<p>
There was a time once, that I believed in you
<p>
Thought you'd keep me safe from my weaknesses when I'd speak to you

Burn it out in the sun alone <p>
Fix my body, fix my soul <p>
Pour the fever from my pores <p>
I'm better on my own <p>
'Cause I know what I'm like on the inside <p>
I should know the way I can make it right <p>
But I don't, and I'm warm and terrified <p>
It just feels like a bad dream <p>

And I don't know what's happening <p>
And I don't know what happened to me <p>
And I don't know how I can be clean again <p>
Think the dirt settle in way too deep <p>
Let it into the rest of me <p>
And I give all the best of me too <p>
I don't like what is left of me <p>
I don't know what is left here to do <p>

Burn it out in the sun alone <p>
Fix my body, fix my soul <p>
Pour the fever from my pores<p>
I'm better on my own<p>
'Cause I know what I'm like on the inside <p>
I should know the way I can make it right <p>
But I don't, and I'm warm and terrified<p>
It just feels like a bad dream<p>

And I don't know what happened to me<p>
No, I don't know what happened to me<p>
There was a time once, that I believed in you.
