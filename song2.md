There was a time once, I thought I could be like you
You should've seen it, all of the meaning, and all of what I can't do anymore
There was a time once, that I believed in you
Thought you'd keep me safe from my weaknesses when I'd speak to you

Burn it out in the sun alone
Fix my body, fix my soul
Pour the fever from my pores
I'm better on my own
'Cause I know what I'm like on the inside
I should know the way I can make it right
But I don't, and I'm warm and terrified
It just feels like a bad dream

And I don't know what's happening
And I don't know what happened to me
And I don't know how I can be clean again
Think the dirt settle in way too deep
Let it into the rest of me
And I give all the best of me too
I don't like what is left of me
I don't know what is left here to do

Burn it out in the sun alone
Fix my body, fix my soul
Pour the fever from my pores
I'm better on my own
'Cause I know what I'm like on the inside
I should know the way I can make it right
But I don't, and I'm warm and terrified
It just feels like a bad dream

And I don't know what happened to me
No, I don't know what happened to me
There was a time once, that I believed in you
