why: I want to take the lyrics of this song and write them out on a scroll of paper and attach it to my wall. The beat of this song is so beautiful and the cadence of the lyrics feels like a prayer. I do hope I die doing what I love.

&nbsp<p>
I could never die for the fame<p>
Hurts so bad, but I live for the pain<p>
Rather hang from a tree than hang with these lames<p>
Making all this music while you're posted in the rave<p>
You don't need to keep going though, I already came<p>
Gold on my bracelet, gold on my chain<p>
Tall girl, tall, yeah she wearing stilettos<p>
We never speak, only a "Hi" or a "Hello"<p>
I'm stunting too hard, guess I didn't get the memo<p>
Green with jealousy, blue and yellow<p>
You think I'm underground, I'm far below<p>
They sleeping on me like I'm made out of pillows<p>
"How doеs he do it man?" I don't know either<p>
I got hoеs loving "Club Sleep" and "Oh Tina"<p>
Point the biggest skeptic out and make him a believer<p>
'Cause I'm sicker than a stomach ache, cold and a fever<p>
&nbsp<p>
I know I'm awake, but it feels like I'm dreaming<p>
Living this life, but I don't know the meaning<p>
Cats stay fiendin, I'm chasing the feeling<p>
Cold like the weather this evening, evening<p>
I know I'm awake but it feels like I'm dreaming<p>
Living this life, but I don't know the meaning<p>
Cats stay fiendin, I'm chasing the feeling<p>
Cold like the weather this evening
Do it for no reason, you only live once<p>
Set fire to the game like I'm sparking my blunt<p>
I'm like Tom Cruise, I do my own stunts<p>
But I hope I die, die, die doin' what I love, love<p>
&nbsp<p>
My phone silent, but I'm seein' the missed calls<p>
I'm this tall, stand on my money, I'm 6'4<p>
I won't fall off, they hate, but I dismiss all<p>
My state golden, man I'm feeling like Chris Paul<p>
I'm hanging from the rope if I know I won't make it<p>
But I'll make it, know it's more than amazing<p>
It ain't loud enough, but the roof I'm raising<p>
It's so close, taste it, sweet like Baileys<p>
I just need the money man, I don't need the ladies<p>
You know what I'ma say, "Only need them if they pay me"<p>
I'm so fucking lazy, don't know what to say man<p>
Essex boy, only thing I'm missing is the spray tan<p>
&nbsp<p>
I know I'm awake, but it feels like I'm dreaming <p>
Living this life, but I don't know the meanin <p>
Cats stay fiendin', I'm chasing the feeling <p>
Cold like the weather this evening, evening <p>
I know I'm awake but it feels like I'm dreaming<p>
Living this life, but I don't know the meaning<p>
Cats stay fiendin', I'm chasing the feeling<p>
Cold like the weather this evening<p>
Do it for no reason, you only live once<p>
Set fire to the game like I'm sparking my blunt<p>
I'm like Tom Cruise, I do my own stunts<p>
But I hope I die, die, die doin' what I love, love
