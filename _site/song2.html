<p> Lyrics: <p>There was a time once, I thought I could be like you
You should've seen it, all of the meaning, and all of what I can't do anymore
There was a time once, that I believed in you
Thought you'd keep me safe from my weaknesses when I'd speak to you</p>
<p>Burn it out in the sun alone
Fix my body, fix my soul
Pour the fever from my pores
I'm better on my own
'Cause I know what I'm like on the inside
I should know the way I can make it right
But I don't, and I'm warm and terrified
It just feels like a bad dream</p>
<p>And I don't know what's happening
And I don't know what happened to me
And I don't know how I can be clean again
Think the dirt settle in way too deep
Let it into the rest of me
And I give all the best of me too
I don't like what is left of me
I don't know what is left here to do</p>
<p>Burn it out in the sun alone
Fix my body, fix my soul
Pour the fever from my pores
I'm better on my own
'Cause I know what I'm like on the inside
I should know the way I can make it right
But I don't, and I'm warm and terrified
It just feels like a bad dream</p>
<p>And I don't know what happened to me
No, I don't know what happened to me
There was a time once, that I believed in you</p>
