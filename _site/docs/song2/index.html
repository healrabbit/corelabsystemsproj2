There was a time once, I thought I could be like you
<p>
You should've seen it, all of the meaning, and all of what I can't do anymore
<p>
There was a time once, that I believed in you
<p>
Thought you'd keep me safe from my weaknesses when I'd speak to you
<p>Burn it out in the sun alone <p>
Fix my body, fix my soul <p>
Pour the fever from my pores <p>
I'm better on my own <p>
'Cause I know what I'm like on the inside <p>
I should know the way I can make it right <p>
But I don't, and I'm warm and terrified <p>
It just feels like a bad dream <p></p>
<p>And I don't know what's happening <p>
And I don't know what happened to me <p>
And I don't know how I can be clean again <p>
Think the dirt settle in way too deep <p>
Let it into the rest of me <p>
And I give all the best of me too <p>
I don't like what is left of me <p>
I don't know what is left here to do <p></p>
<p>Burn it out in the sun alone <p>
Fix my body, fix my soul <p>
Pour the fever from my pores<p>
I'm better on my own<p>
'Cause I know what I'm like on the inside <p>
I should know the way I can make it right <p>
But I don't, and I'm warm and terrified<p>
It just feels like a bad dream<p></p>
<p>And I don't know what happened to me<p>
No, I don't know what happened to me<p>
There was a time once, that I believed in you.</p>
