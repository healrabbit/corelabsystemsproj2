why: I listened to this song on unreleased Alex G playlists on Soundcloud for a year or so until the album Race got an official streaming release in 2021. I was so happy. I remember I made an art piece inspired by this song and posted it to instagram. That's how you know a song is good haha. I love Alex's whiney voice proclaiming "I'm not the same". So special.

<div style="font-size:10px;">
&nbsp<p>
I was a girl<p>
I was the only kid in the world, I thought I knew<p>
What it meant to you<p>
But I'm wrong<p>
I'm wrong, I'm wrong<p>
&nbsp<p>
I'm not okay<p>
In fact, I'm sick today, I'm on the floor<p>
It's such a bore<p>
It's nothing new to you<p>
I'll be downstairs, let me do my hair<p>
And put my makeup on, it feels so wrong<p>
You say "Rock on"<p>
I'm not the same<p>
&nbsp<p>
Everybody wants you, yeah<p>
Everybody loves you<p>
Your smile, your teeth, your hair<p>
They don't know you're not there<p>
They don't know you're not there<p>
Too fast, too slow, too late<p>
You are never gonna make it<p>
You're never gonna make it<p>
(I'm not the same)
</p>
